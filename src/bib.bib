  abstract = {The Matrix is a 1999 science fiction action film written and directed by The Wachowskis and starring Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne, Carrie-Anne Moss, Hugo Weaving, and Joe Pantoliano. It depicts a dystopian future in which reality as perceived by most humans is actually a simulated reality called "the Matrix", created by sentient machines to subdue the human population, while their bodies' heat and electrical activity are used as an energy source. Cybercriminal and computer programmer Neo learns this truth and is drawn into a rebellion against the machines, which involves other people who have been freed from the "dream world".
The Matrix is known for popularizing a visual effect known as "bullet time", in which the heightened perception of certain characters is represented by allowing the action within a shot to progress in slow-motion while the camera's viewpoint appears to move through the scene at normal speed. The film is an example of the cyberpunk subgenre. It contains numerous references to philosophical and religious ideas, and pays homage to works such as Plato's Allegory of the Cave, Jean Baudrillard's Simulacra and Simulation, Lewis Carroll's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, and Masamune Shirow's Ghost in the Shell. The Wachowskis' approach to action scenes drew upon their admiration for Japanese animation and martial arts films, and the film's use of fight choreographers and wire fu techniques from Hong Kong action cinema influenced subsequent Hollywood action film productions.
The Matrix was first released in the United States on March 31, 1999 and grossed over \$460 million worldwide. It was well-received by critics and won four Academy Awards, as well as other accolades, including BAFTA Awards and Saturn Awards. Reviewers praised The Matrix for its innovative visual effects, cinematography and entertainment value. The film has since appeared in lists of the greatest science fiction films, and, in 2012, was added to the National Film Registry for preservation. The success of the film led to the release of two feature film sequels, both written and directed by the Wachowskis: The Matrix Reloaded and The Matrix Revolutions. The Matrix franchise was further expanded through the production of comic books, video games and animated short films, in which the Wachowskis were heavily involved, and even inspired books and theories on ideas in religion and philosophy.},

MR displays are defined by means of seven examples of existingdisplay concepts in which real objects and virtual objects are juxtaposed. Essential factors which distinguishdifferent Mixed Reality display systems from each other are presented, first by means of a table in whichthe nature of the underlying scene, how it is viewed, and the observer's reference to it are compared, andthen by means of a three dimensional taxonomic framework, comprising: Extent of World Knowledge(EWK), Reproduction Fidelity (RF) and Extent of Presence Metaphor (EPM). A principal objective of thetaxonomy is to clarify terminology issues and to provide a framework for classifying research acrossdifferent disciplines},
